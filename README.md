## 🌟 Project Origin & Vision

### Why Loglings Exists

After years in cybersecurity, I (Teshera) noticed something troubling: too many brilliant minds were intimidated away from our field by harsh, unwelcoming learning environments. Security is often taught through fear, complexity, and stress - but it doesn't have to be.

**The Vision**: Create a space where learning cybersecurity feels like coming home to a warm fireplace. Where making mistakes is part of the journey, not a failure. Where complex concepts are wrapped in gentle stories that make them approachable and memorable.

**The Mission**: Make cybersecurity education accessible to everyone, regardless of background, by combining professional-grade learning with cozy game design.

### Community Values

Our forest thrives on these principles:
- 🌱 **Growth over Perfection**: Mistakes help us learn
- 🤗 **Inclusion over Intimidation**: Everyone belongs here  
- 🧠 **Understanding over Memorization**: We build intuition, not just knowledge
- 💚 **Support over Competition**: We grow together
- ✨ **Joy over Stress**: Learning should spark curiosity, not anxiety
